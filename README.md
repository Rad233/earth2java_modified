## Earth2Java - MOBS

###Description
This mod aims to bring mobs from Minecraft Earth to Minecraft Java Edition. Is not intented as a simple retexture of some chicken, but want to brings also AI, loot and special mechanics they have in MCE, if any.
Most of the mobs have a generic Plains biome in MCE, I set entities in some more specific biome to diversify.
More mobs will come with future update of this mods. 
Please, report any bug you found and tell me if you have any suggestion.
